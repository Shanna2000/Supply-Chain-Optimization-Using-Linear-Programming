# Supply-Chain-Optimization-Using-Linear-Programming
In this project, I aim to optimize supply chain management using a Linear Programming Model. The goal is to minimize freight and warehouse costs for orders. There're seven tables to process before inputting the data into the model, enabling us to find the most cost-effective solution.
